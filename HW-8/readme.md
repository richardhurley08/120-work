## Week 8 - for loops & while loops
---

 This week we were able to draw something using `for` `while`, and `let`.

<p> This week I read all of the website information. I was able to get this weeks assignment done early in the week. </p>

<p> I had no issues this week.  </p>

I did not use the issues forum this week.
