## Week 13 Proposal
---




<p> I want to make something inspirational with relaxing music. Something biblical preferably. I have an idea for a bible verse already. I got this idea because I’m a musician in my churches worship team and when we play the lyrics are on a huge screen behind us, so everyone can sing along without getting confused on the lyrics. </p>

<p> I would love to have the bible verses change over time but at the moment I’m having an issue with that and only displaying one. </p>

<p> I am going to review many of the past content from the website to refresh my memory because this to me is more of a serious project for me. At this point all my classes are coming to an end and time management is key. I plan on dedicating more time to this assignment than I have in the past.  </p>
