## Week 10 - Functions
---



<p> This week I read all the website information. I started trying to create a snow screen using a wallpaper .jpg but I couldnâ€™t get it to work and before I knew it I had a different effect that reminded me of carbonation from a fizzy drink so i went with it. </p>

<p> I had no issues this week.  </p>

I did not use the issues forum this week.
